# Wollump

A shameless rip-off of [Gollum](http://github.com/gollum/gollum) in .NET.

## Why?

Just playing :smiley:

> Aren't you working on porting [Gollum to Windows](http://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/pull/16)?

Yes, but in the meantime, i want to play with [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org) and [libgit2sharp](http://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) and get better at the web.

If you want to get git wikis working on Windows, please help put [Gollum on Windows](http://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/pull/16) for real. i doubt this will reach the level of refinement that application already enjoys.

## Wollump?

When Gollum gets Wollumped by Windows that's the sound he makes, amiright?
