# Wollump

A shameless rip-off of [Gollum](http://github.com/gollum/gollum) in .NET.

> But aren't you working on porting [Gollum to Windows](http://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/pull/16)?

Yes, but in the meantime, i want to play with [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org) and [libgit2sharp](http://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp).

Wollump sounds right, no?
